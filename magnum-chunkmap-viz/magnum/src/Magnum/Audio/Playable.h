/**
@brief Playable

Feature which manages the position, orientation and gain of a @ref Source for
an @ref SceneGraph::Object.

@section Audio-Playable-usage Usage

Attach the instance to an existing object and set a filled buffer to it. In
order to reflect transformation changes from the scene in the spatial audio,
the playable should be added to some @ref PlayableGroup, which is periodically
updated from a currently active @ref Listener using @ref Listener::update():

@snippet MagnumAudio-scenegraph.cpp Playable-usage

Note that @ref Source::setPosition(), @ref Source::setDirection() and
@ref Source::setGain() called on @ref source() will be overwritten on next call
to @ref Listener::update() / @ref PlayableGroup::setGain() / @ref setGain() and
you have to use other means to update them:

-   Transformation of the source is inherited from the scene. If you want to
    transform it, transform the @ref SceneGraph::Object the playable is
    attached to. It's also possible to affect the global listener
    and group transformation using @ref Listener::setSoundTransformation() and
    @ref PlayableGroup::setSoundTransformation()
-   The source is by default omnidirectional (i.e., passing a zero vector to
    @ref Source::setDirection()). You can set the initial direction using the
    @ref Playable(SceneGraph::AbstractObject<dimensions, Float>&, const VectorTypeFor<dimensions, Float>&, PlayableGroup<dimensions>*)
    constructor, the direction will be automatically rotated based on playable
    transformation.
-   Source gain is set as a combination of @ref PlayableGroup gain and
    @ref Playable gain and updated on every call to @ref setGain() or
    @ref PlayableGroup::setGain().
