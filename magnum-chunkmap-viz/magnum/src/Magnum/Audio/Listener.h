/**
@brief Listener

Feature which manages the position, orientation and gain of the OpenAL listener
for a @ref SceneGraph::Object.

@section Audio-Listener-usage Usage

The listener will be commonly used together with a bunch of @ref Playable
features, managed in one or more @ref PlayableGroup instances. In order to
reflect transformation changes affecting the scene, you need to call
@ref update() after each change (or simply every frame):

@snippet MagnumAudio-scenegraph.cpp Listener-usage

For two-dimensional scenes simply replace all `3D` with `2D`. See @ref Playable
for more info about how to set up and group audio sources.

@section Audio-Listener-active-listener Active listener

There can only be at most *one* active listener at a given time, i.e. the one
on which @ref Listener::update() was called last. This is because OpenAL
only supports notion of one listener. Having multiple @ref Listener2D or
@ref Listener3D instances can still be useful for conveniently switching
between them for cinematics for example.

@section Audio-Listener-sound-transformation Sound transformation

@ref Listener::setSoundTransformation() enables you to set a transformation
matrix which is applied to the listeners orientation and position before passed
onto OpenAL. This can be used for rotating two dimensional scenes as planes
into the three dimensional audio space or even scaling the audio scene to match
a certain world scale. In the later case you might want to instead consider
@ref Renderer::setSpeedOfSound().
