The @p subdivisions parameter describes how many times is each icosphere
triangle subdivided, recursively. Specifying @cpp 0 @ce will result in an
icosphere with 12 vertices and 20 faces, saying @cpp 1 @ce will result in an
icosphere with 80 faces (each triangle subdivided into four smaller), saying
@cpp 2 @ce will result in 320 faces and so on. In particular, this is different
from the `subdivisions` parameter in @ref grid3DSolid() or @ref grid3DWireframe().
