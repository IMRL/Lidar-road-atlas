/* Can't be just an array of Vector2 but has to be a struct, because then MSVC
   2015 fails with an assertion like

    Trade::MeshData: attribute 0 [0x7ffd6c4fb290:0x7ffd6c4fb338] is not contained in passed vertexData array [0x7ffd6c4fb170:0x7ffd6c4fb218]

   which leads me to believe that it will make two copies of the data, one for
   the MeshAttributeData constructor and one for the MeshData constructor. Same
   for the Cube, Square and Plane primitives. Interestingly enough, this isn't
   a problem for index arrays (maybe because those are integers and not
   constexpr classes?). Also not a problem for MSVC 2017 and up. */
