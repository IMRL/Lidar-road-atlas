@brief Save a screenshot to a file
@param framebuffer  Framebuffer which to read
@param filename     File where to save
@m_since{2019,10}

Reads a rectangle of given @p framebuffer, defined by its
@ref GL::AbstractFramebuffer::viewport() "viewport()". Pixel format is queried
using @ref GL::AbstractFramebuffer::implementationColorReadFormat() and
@ref GL::AbstractFramebuffer::implementationColorReadType() and then mapped
back to the generic @ref Magnum::PixelFormat "PixelFormat". If, for some
reason, the driver-suggested pixel format is not desired, use the
@ref screenshot(GL::AbstractFramebuffer&, PixelFormat, const std::string&)
overload instead.

The read pixel data are saved using the
@ref Trade::AnyImageConverter "AnyImageConverter" plugin, with format being
detected from @p filename. Note that every file format supports a different set
of pixel formats, it's the user responsibility to choose a file format that
matches the framebuffer pixel format.

Returns @cpp true @ce on success, @cpp false @ce in case it was not possible to
map the detected pixel format back to a generic format, if either the
@ref Trade::AnyImageConverter "AnyImageConverter" or the corresponding plugin
for given file format could not be loaded, or if the file saving fails (for
example due to unsupported pixel format). A message is printed in each case.

Similar to @ref screenshot(GL::AbstractFramebuffer&, PixelFormat, const std::string&)
but with an explicit pixel format. Useful in cases where the driver-suggested
pixel format is not desired, however note that supplying a format that's
incompatible with the framebuffer may result in GL errors.
