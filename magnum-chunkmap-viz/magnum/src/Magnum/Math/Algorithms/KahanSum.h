@brief Kahan summation algorithm
@param[in] begin            Range begin
@param[in] end              Range end
@param[in] sum              Initial value for the sum
@param[in,out] compensation Floating-point roundoff error compensation value.
    If non-@cpp nullptr @ce, value behind the pointer is used as initial
    compensation value and the resulting compensation value is saved back
    there.

Calculates a sum of a large range of floating-point numbers with roundoff error
compensation. Compared to for example @ref std::accumulate() the algorithm
significantly reduces numerical error in the total. See the
[Kahan summation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm)
article on Wikipedia for an in-depth explanation. Example with summation of a
hundred million ones:

@snippet MagnumMathAlgorithms.cpp kahanSum

If required, it is also possible to use this algorithm on non-contiguous ranges
or single values (for example when calculating sum of pixel values in an image
with some row padding or when the inputs are generated / converted from other
values):

@snippet MagnumMathAlgorithms.cpp kahanSum-iterative
*/
template<class Iterator, class T = typename std::decay<decltype(*std::declval<Iterator>())>::type> T kahanSum(Iterator begin, Iterator end, T sum = T(0), T* compensation = nullptr) {
    T c = compensation ? *compensation : T(0);
    for(Iterator it = begin; it != end; ++it) {
        const T y = *it - c;
        const T t = sum + y;
        c = (t - sum) - y;
        sum = t;
    }

    if(compensation) *compensation = c;
    return sum;
}
