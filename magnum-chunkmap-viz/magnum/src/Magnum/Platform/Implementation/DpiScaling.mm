       Before 10.15, HiDPI is available only for bundles, so (if the executable
       is not a bundle or) the key is not specified, returning false. On 10.15,
       according to the global consensus (but nothing really confirmed by
       apple) in the following issues / changes

        https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/674

       ... it seems that HiDPI is the default. THANKS APPLE FOR CONFIRMING IT
       SO CLEARLY IN YOUR CHANGELOG AND DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION! So returning
       true if the key is not specified and version is 10.15+.

       Of course, I have absolutely no idea how is it on iOS. So there it'll
       assume it's since iOS 13 (which has the ~same release date as macOS
       10.15) so I suppose both changes were done in tandem. In any case it's
       less of a problem because almost nobody looks at the logs anyway. Eh. */

           alternatives that should work on older versions as well, but right
