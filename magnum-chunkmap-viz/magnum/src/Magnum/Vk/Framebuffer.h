@brief Framebuffer
@m_since_latest

Wraps a @type_vk_keyword{Framebuffer}, which connects a @ref RenderPass
together with concrete @ref ImageView "ImageViews" for attachments.

@section Vk-Framebuffer-creation Framebuffer creation

A framebuffer is created using @ref FramebufferCreateInfo that takes a
previously-created @ref RenderPass together with @ref ImageView "ImageViews"
onto @ref Image "Images" of desired sizes and compatible formats for all its attachments:
