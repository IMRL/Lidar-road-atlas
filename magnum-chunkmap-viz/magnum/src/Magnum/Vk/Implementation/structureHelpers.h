/* Given a chain of structures that are always connected in the same order (but
   not necessarily all of them), in which `next` points to the first structure
   of the chain, the function disconnects the chain from `next`, replacing the
   pointer with the first `pNext` value that points outside of the chain. The
   `structures` themselves are not touched in any way.

    Given the following, where 0-9 are the `structures` and 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
    form a chain in which the last `pNext` points to `out`:

    next   ___         ___      out

      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

    The result is the following --- the structures are left intact, and `next`
    now points directly to `out`. After that, the structures can be cleared and
    repurposed or discarded without a risk of losing access to the chain end.
