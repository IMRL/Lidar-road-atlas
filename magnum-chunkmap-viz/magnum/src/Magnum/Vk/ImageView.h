/**
@brief Image view
@m_since_latest

View onto an @ref Image. Wraps a @type_vk_keyword{ImageView}.

@section Vk-ImageView-creation Image view creation

Similarly to @ref Image, a view is created by passing one of the
@ref ImageViewCreateInfo subclasses with desired layer/level range to the
@ref Image constructor. Commonly you'd use the same @ref ImageViewCreateInfo
subclass as @ref ImageCreateInfo, but other combinations are possible as well
--- see docs of each subclass for more information.

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp ImageView-creation

While it would be *technically* possible to infer a view type from the
originating @ref Image and thus avoid having to specify the type twice, the
mapping isn't crystal clear in all cases and could cause hard-to-detect issues
if you suddenly get an unexpected view type. Thus the view type is required to
be always explicitly specified.
