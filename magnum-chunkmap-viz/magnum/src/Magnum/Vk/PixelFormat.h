/**
@brief Pixel format
@m_since_latest

Wraps a subset of @type_vk_keyword{Format} that's usable as a pixel format.

Note that while Vulkan exposes almost all imaginable formats, they're not
universally usable in all scenarios and the support differs from device to
device. To make things simpler, Vulkan provides implicit guarantees where
certain formats can be used, see documentation of each value for more
information. Generally, the following rules apply for uncompressed color
formats:

-   All implicit guarantees are only for optimal tiling, not linear
-   RGB formats of all sizes don't have *any* guarantees due to alignment
    issues, and use of two- or four-channel formats is preferred
-   Single-channel formats provide the same guarantees as a corresponding
    two-channel format, possibly supporting more
-   While 8-bit normalized formats have guaranteed support for linear filtering
    and blending, it's not implicitly guaranteed for 16-bit normalized formats
    --- the support is common, but not universal.
-   Signed normalized formats don't have blit destination and color attachment
    support guaranteed as opposed to unsigned normalized formats
-   Signed and unsigned integral formats of the same channel size and count
    provide the exact same guarantees
-   Shader storage support is implicitly guaranteed only for full-width
    (32-bit) formats, for others it depends on
    @ref DeviceFeature::ShaderStorageImageExtendedFormats
-   Atomic operation support is only guaranteed for single-channel full-width
    integral formats

For compressed color formats, sampling, blit source and linear filtering has
guaranteed support with optimal tiling either for all BC formats, all ETC
formats or all ASTC LDR formats, and a full support for a particular family of
these formats is denoted by the @ref DeviceFeature::TextureCompressionBc,
@ref DeviceFeature::TextureCompressionEtc2 and
@ref DeviceFeature::TextureCompressionAstcLdr features.
