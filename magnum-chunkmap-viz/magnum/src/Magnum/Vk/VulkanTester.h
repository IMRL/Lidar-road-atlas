/**
@brief Base class for Vulkan tests and benchmarks
@m_since_latest

Extends @ref Corrade::TestSuite::Tester with features for Vulkan testing and
benchmarking. Be sure to read its documentation first to have an overview of
the base features.

This class is built into a separate static library and only if
`WITH_VULKANTESTER` is enabled when building Magnum. To use it with CMake,
request the `VulkanTester` component of the `Magnum` package. Derive your test
class from this class instead of @ref Corrade::TestSuite::Tester and
either link to `Magnum::VulkanTester` target or add it to the `LIBRARIES`
section of the @ref corrade-cmake-add-test "corrade_add_test()" macro:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(Magnum REQUIRED VulkanTester)

# ...
corrade_add_test(YourTest YourTest.cpp LIBRARIES Magnum::VulkanTester)
@endcode

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, ensure it's enabled
as it's not built by default:

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_OPENGLTESTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
@endcode

See @ref building, @ref cmake and @ref testsuite for more information.

@section Vk-VulkanTester-device Vulkan device and instance creation

The class implicitly creates a Vulkan @ref Instance and @ref Device with
default layers and extensions and one graphics queue. These are then available
through @ref instance(), @ref device() and @ref queue() getters.

If you want to create a custom device, use the @ref VulkanTester(NoCreateT)
constructor. You can then move the device and queue instances to the getters to
make them available through common interfaces again. If you want to create a
custom instance as well, use the @ref VulkanTester(NoCreateT, NoCreateT)
variant.
