/**
@brief Render pass
@m_since_latest

Wraps a @type_vk_keyword{RenderPass}, represents a collection of attachment
descriptions, subpasses and their dependencies. The render pass description is
independent of any specific image views used for attachments, these two are
connected together in a @ref Framebuffer.

@section Vk-RenderPass-creation Render pass creation

A @ref RenderPassCreateInfo consists of:

-   a set of attachments, described by @ref AttachmentDescription instances,
-   subpasses operating on those attachments, described by a
    @ref SubpassDescription using @ref AttachmentReference instances,
-   and subpass dependencies, described by @ref SubpassDependency.

A render pass has to have at least one subpass. It's common to have just one
subpass, but while the subpass isn't required to operate on any attachments,
such case is rather rare. Following is a simple setup for one subpass operating
on a color and a combined depth/stencil attachment. Each
@ref AttachmentDescription describes a concrete attachment and particular
@ref SubpassDescription::setColorAttachments() /
@ref SubpassDescription::setDepthStencilAttachment() "setColorAttachments()"
then reference it by an index.

In addition to a format, each @ref AttachmentDescription has to specify an
@ref AttachmentLoadOperation that happens at the render pass begin --- whether
we want to preserve the contents, clear them or discard --- and similarly an
@ref AttachmentStoreOperation at the end. Then, the @ref ImageLayout parameters
specify what implicit layout transitions (if any) need to happen between start
of the render pass and the first subpass, between subpasses and between last
subpass and end of the render pass.

The following snippet shows attachment and subpass setup for a single-pass
color/depth render. Commonly the image is used in some way after the render
pass, in this case it'll get transferred to the host, as indicated by
@ref ImageLayout::TransferSource. That will also need an explicit subpass
dependency, as explained below.

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp RenderPass-creation

<b></b>

@m_class{m-note m-info}

@par
    @ref ImageLayout::Undefined also doubles as a way of saying "transition
    from whatever layout is there" --- when we render to an attachment for the
    first time, it will most probably be in @ref ImageLayout::Undefined, but
    subsequently it won't anymore and instead be
    @ref ImageLayout::ColorAttachment,
    @ref ImageLayout::DepthStencilAttachment "DepthStencilAttachment" or just
    any other. With @ref ImageLayout::Undefined we don't need to explicitly
    handle that case.

@subsection Vk-RenderPass-creation-subpass-dependencies Subpass dependencies

As shown above, the application is required to specify @ref ImageLayout at the
start and end of the render pass as well as layouts in which the attachments
are expected to be inside a particular subpass, and Vulkan then takes care of
doing layout transitions at a proper time. If a transition from one layout to
another needs to occur, a @ref SubpassDependency defines when, and if none is
explicitly specified, an implicit dependency is added by Vulkan. The above
setup can be visualized as this, with implicit transitions shown as arrows:

@dotfile vk-renderpass-layouts.dot

The implicit dependencies added by Vulkan only ensure that the transition from
@ref ImageLayout::Undefined to @ref ImageLayout::ColorAttachment "ColorAttachment"
/ @ref ImageLayout::DepthStencilAttachment "DepthStencilAttachment" happen *at
some point* before the start of the renderpass, and the transition to
@ref ImageLayout::TransferSource "TransferSource" is *eventually* done as well.
In this case the initial transition is fine; for the transfer layout transition
we however need it to happen before we do the actual transfer:

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp RenderPass-dependencies

@section Vk-RenderPass-usage Render pass recording

A render pass recording inside a @ref CommandBuffer is begun with
@ref CommandBuffer::beginRenderPass(), to which point Vulkan schedules all
implicit layout transitions. Together with a render pass you need to supply a
compatible @ref Framebuffer containing actual image views for each attachment
and a clear value for each attachment that had
@ref AttachmentLoadOperation::Clear specified. After that you can execute
@ref CommandBuffer commands that are allowed inside a render pass:

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp RenderPass-usage-begin

Advancing to the next subpass (if any) can be done with
@ref CommandBuffer::nextSubpass() "nextSubpass()", and finally
@ref CommandBuffer::endRenderPass() "endRenderPass()" ends the render pass. As
with render pass begin, these make Vulkan schedule implicit layout transitions
between subpasses and at render pass end.
