/**
@brief Glyph cache with distance field rendering

Unlike original @ref GlyphCache converts each binary image to distance field.
It is not possible to use non-binary colors with this cache, internal texture
format is red channel only.

@section Text-DistanceFieldGlyphCache-usage Usage

Usage is similar to @ref GlyphCache, additionally you need to specify size of
resulting distance field texture.

@snippet MagnumText.cpp DistanceFieldGlyphCache-usage

@note This class is available only if Magnum is compiled with
    @ref MAGNUM_TARGET_GL enabled (done by default). See @ref building-features
    for more information.

         *      been rendered when blitting is not supported to save memory?
