@brief Combine differently indexed attributes into a single mesh
@m_since{2020,06}

Assuming each @p data contains only unique vertex data, creates an indexed mesh
that contains all attributes from @p data combined, with duplicate vertices
removed. For example, when you have a position and a normal array, each indexed
with separate indices like this:

@code{.cpp}
{pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF}        // positions
{nA, nB, nC, nD, nE, nF, nG}    // normals

{0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 2}     // position indices
{1, 3, 4, 1, 4, 6, 1, 3, 1}     // normal indices
@endcode

Then the first triangle in the mesh is defined as
@cb{.cpp} {pA, nB}, {pC, nD}, {pF, nE} @ce. When combined together using this
function, the resulting mesh stays the same but there's just one index array,
indexing both positions and normals:

@code{.cpp}
{{pA, nB}, {pC, nD}, {pF, nE}, {pA, nE}, {pB, nG}, {pD, nB}, {pC, nB}}
                                // unique pairs of positions and normals

{0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6}     // unified indices
@endcode

The function preserves all attribute data including repeated or custom
attributes. The resulting mesh is interleaved, with all attributes packed
tightly together. If you need to add specific padding for alignment
preservation, pass the result to @ref interleave() and specify the paddings
between attributes manually. Similarly, for simplicity the resulting mesh has
always @ref MeshIndexType::UnsignedInt --- use @ref compressIndices(const Trade::MeshData&, MeshIndexType)
if you want to have it compressed to a smaller type.

Vertex data unreferenced by the index buffers are discarded. This means the
function can be also called with just a single argument to compact a mesh with
a sparse index buffer.

Expects that @p data is non-empty and all data have the same primitive and
index count. All inputs have to be indexed. For non-indexed attributes
combining can be done much more efficiently using @ref duplicate(const Trade::MeshData&, Containers::ArrayView<const Trade::MeshAttributeData>),
alternatively you can turn a non-indexed attribute to an indexed one first
using @ref removeDuplicatesInPlace() and then call this function. Index buffers
and attributes in all meshes are expected to not have an
implementation-specific format.
@see @ref isMeshIndexTypeImplementationSpecific(),
    @ref isVertexFormatImplementationSpecific()

/**
@brief Combine per-face attributes into an existing mesh
@m_since{2020,06}

The resulting mesh will have all per-face attributes turned into per-vertex
attributes, leaving only unique combinations and adjusting the index buffer
accordingly. The resulting mesh has the same amount of indices, but likely
more vertices.

Expects that @p mesh is indexed @ref MeshPrimitive::Triangles and
@p faceAttributes is @ref MeshPrimitive::Faces, with face element count of the
latter corresponding to triangle count of the former. If @p faceAttributes is
indexed, it's assumed to have the data unique; if it's not indexed, it's first
made unique using @ref removeDuplicates() and in that case it's expected to
be interleaved. Index buffers and attributes in both meshes are expected to not
have an implementation-specific format.

Same as above with @p faceAttributes wrapped in a @ref Trade::MeshData with
@ref MeshPrimitive::Faces and no index buffer. Same as in the above case,
@p faceAttributes is expected to be interleaved. Note that offset-only
@ref Trade::MeshAttributeData instances are not supported in the
@p faceAttributes array.
