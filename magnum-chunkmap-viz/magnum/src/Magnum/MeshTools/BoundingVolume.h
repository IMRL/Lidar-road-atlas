@brief Calculate an approximate bounding sphere using the Bouncing Bubble
    algorithm
@param positions    Vertex positions
@return Sphere center and radius
@m_since_latest

The resulting bounding sphere is not usually minimal. According to the author,
a 1% to 2% error can be expected. Due to the nature of the algorithm, the
radius is never below @ref Math::TypeTraits::epsilon(), even for empty or
entirely overlapping lists of points. <em>NaN</em>s are ignored, unless the
first position is <em>NaN</em> in which case it is propagated. Algorithm used:

problem, 2012, https://www.grin.com/document/204869*.
