@brief Full screen triangle mesh

Returns a pre-configured mesh along with vertex buffer which can be used for
full-screen post-processing effects. The mesh is a single triangle covering
whole screen area (@f$ (-1, -1) - (1, 1) @f$ in both dimensions) and provides
only vertex positions, as other attributes (such as texture coordinates) can be
calculated from them. The vertex positions are, in order:
@f[
    \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
@f]

Based on the @p version parameter, on OpenGL 2.1, OpenGL ES 2.0 and WebGL 1 the
vertex positions are passed explicitly as attribute @cpp 0 @ce, contained in
a vertex buffer owned by the mesh. On OpenGL 3.0+, OpenGL ES 3.0+ and WebGL 2
the mesh is attribute-less and the vertex positions can be calculated using the
@glsl gl_VertexID @ce builtin shader variable.

Calculating positions in the shader in a portable way can be done like this.
For OpenGL 2.1 and OpenGL ES 2.0 you then need to bind location of the
`position` attribute to @cpp 0 @ce.
