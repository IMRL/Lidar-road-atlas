@brief Pack textures into texture atlas
@param atlasSize    Size of resulting atlas
@param sizes        Sizes of all textures in the atlas
@param padding      Padding around each texture

Packs many small textures into one larger. If the textures cannot be packed
into required size, empty vector is returned.

Padding is added twice to each size and the atlas is laid out so the padding
don't overlap. Returned sizes are the same as original sizes, i.e. without the
padding.
