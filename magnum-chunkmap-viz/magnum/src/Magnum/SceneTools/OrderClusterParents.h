/**
@brief Calculate ordered and clustered parents
@m_since_latest

Extracts the @ref Trade::SceneField::Parent field from @p scene and converts it
to match the following rules:

-   a parent object reference appears always before any of its children
-   the array is clustered so children sharing the same parent are together

This form is useful primarily for calculating absolute object transformations,
for example:

@snippet MagnumSceneTools.cpp orderClusterParents-transformations

The operation is done in an @f$ \mathcal{O}(n) @f$ execution time and memory
complexity, with @f$ n @f$ being @ref Trade::SceneData::mappingBound(). The
@ref Trade::SceneField::Parent field is expected to be contained in the scene,
having no cycles (i.e., every node listed just once) and not being sparse
(i.e., every node listed in the field reachable from the root).

/**
@brief Calculate ordered and clustered parents into a pre-allocated view
@m_since_latest

Like @ref orderClusterParents(), but puts the result into
@p mappingDestination and @p parentDestination instead of allocating a new
array. Expect that both views have a size equal to size of the
@ref Trade::SceneField::Parent view in @p scene.
