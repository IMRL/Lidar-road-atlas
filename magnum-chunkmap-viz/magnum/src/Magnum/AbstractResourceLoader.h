/**
@brief Base for resource loaders

Provides (a)synchronous resource loading for @ref ResourceManager.

@section AbstractResourceLoader-usage Usage and subclassing

Usage is done by subclassing. Subclass instances can be added to
@ref ResourceManager using @ref ResourceManager::setLoader(). After adding the
loader, each call to @ref ResourceManager::get() will call @ref load()
implementation unless the resource is already loaded (or loading is in
progress). Note that resources requested before the loader was added are not
affected by the loader.

Subclassing is done by implementing at least @ref doLoad() function. The
loading can be done synchronously or asynchronously (i.e., in another thread).
The base implementation provides interface to @ref ResourceManager and manages
loading progress (which is then available through functions @ref requestedCount(),
@ref loadedCount() and @ref notFoundCount()). You shouldn't access the
@ref ResourceManager directly when loading the data.

In your @ref doLoad() implementation, after your resources are loaded, call
@ref set() to pass them to @ref ResourceManager or call @ref setNotFound() to
indicate that the resource was not found.

You can also implement @ref doName() to provide meaningful names for resource
keys.

Example implementation for synchronous mesh loader:

@snippet Magnum.cpp AbstractResourceLoader-implementation

You can then add it to resource manager instance like this. Note that the
manager automatically deletes the all loaders on destruction before unloading
all resources. It allows you to use resources in the loader itself without
having to delete the loader explicitly to ensure proper resource unloading. In
the following code, however, the loader destroys itself (and removes itself
from the manager) before the manager is destroyed.
