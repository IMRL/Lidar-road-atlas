@section platforms-linux-travis Setting up Linux build on Travis CI

In general, a Linux build is done by adding the following to your `.travis.yml`
matrix build. Currently Ubuntu 14.04 is the latest you can get. See
[the official documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/trusty/)
for more information.

@code{.yml}
matrix:
  include:
  - language: cpp
    os: linux
    dist: trusty
    compiler: gcc
@endcode

It's advisable to use the container builds instead of the sudo-enabled ones as
they are generally much faster to boot up, however they have restrictions on
what packages can be installed. Installing packages is done by adding the
following to your `.travis.yml`

@code{.yml}
matrix:
  include:
  - language: cpp
    os: linux
    ...
    addons:
      apt:
        packages:
        - ninja-build
        - libsdl2-dev
        ...
@endcode

You can find out how's the package named by searching for Ubuntu Trusty
packages. The packages are whitelisted, be sure to check the `ubuntu-trusty`
file in https://github.com/travis-ci/apt-package-whitelist before adding a
package to the list. Some packages might require enabling a third-party PPA, a
whitelist for them is at https://github.com/travis-ci/apt-source-whitelist. If
a package is not whitelisted, you can either request it by opening an issue on
these repos (prepare that it may take *long* to get through in some cases), or
build it manually and then cache the result.

Travis supports ANSI color escape codes, so don't forget to enable colored
output for @ref Corrade::TestSuite output. It supports more than just ANSI
color escaping --- if you use Ninja, it will display just the condensed
single-line output.

@code{.sh}
CORRADE_TEST_COLOR=ON ctest -V
@endcode
