/** @relatedalso BigEnumSet
@brief Print a big enum set to debug output
@param debug    Debug output
@param value    Value to be printed
@param empty    What to print in case of an empty enum set
@m_since_latest

Compared to @ref enumSetDebugOutput(), this function doesn't need an explicit
list of known values but will instead go through all set bits and print them
one by one. This also means unknown bits, if any, will be interleaved with the
known ones. Example definition:

@snippet Containers.cpp bigEnumSetDebugOutput

The output is then as follows:

@snippet Containers.cpp bigEnumSetDebugOutput-usage
*/
/* The set has to be taken by value because it gets modified in the process */
template<class T, std::size_t size> Utility::Debug& bigEnumSetDebugOutput(Utility::Debug& debug, BigEnumSet<T, size> value, const char* empty) {
    /* Print the empty value in case there is nothing */
    if(!value) return debug << empty;

    /* Go through all bits in the range and print each of them, if set. This
       will mean known and unknown values will be interleaved, but better than
       forcing users to supply a list of 100+ values like with EnumSet. */
    bool separate = false;
    for(std::size_t i = 0; value && i != size*64; ++i) {
        if(!(value & T(i))) continue;

        if(separate) debug << Utility::Debug::nospace << "|" << Utility::Debug::nospace;
        else separate = true;
        debug << T(i);

        /* Clear the value from the enum so we can do an early exit if there's
           no more bits set */
        value &= ~T(i);
    }

    return debug;
}
