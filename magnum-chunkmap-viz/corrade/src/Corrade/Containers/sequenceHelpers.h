#ifndef DOXYGEN_GENERATING_OUTPUT /* it should ignore, but it doesn't */
/* E.g. GenerateSequence<3>::Type is Sequence<0, 1, 2> */
template<std::size_t ...> struct Sequence {};

/* Originally GenerateSequence was implemented as a simple linear generator:

    template<std::size_t N, std::size_t ...sequence> struct GenerateSequence:
        GenerateSequence<N-1, N-1, sequence...> {};

    template<std::size_t ...sequence> struct GenerateSequence<0, sequence...> {
        typedef Sequence<sequence...> Type;
    };

   However, O(n) is needlessly inefficient and a much better O(log n)
   implementation can be done by splitting the work in half and then joining
   the two sequences together. For GenerateSequence<65> that'll results in the
   compiler generating in addition just GenerateSequence<33>, <32>, <16>, <8>,
   <4> and <2> instead of 64 new types. For more extreme cases that results in
   rather significant memory and time savings -- running the
   SequenceHelpersTest as-is (baseline) and with GenerateSequence<899>
   uncommented (which is the maximum template recursion depth in the original
   implementation) improved as following:

                        | before            | after
    --------------------+-------------------+---------------
    GCC 10 baseline     | 37 MB, 0.13 s     | 37 MB, 0.13 s
    Clang 10 baseline   | 91 MB, 0.15 s     | 92 MB, 0.16 s
    GCC 10 <899>        | 275 MB, 0.62 s    | 38 MB, 0.12 s
    Clang 10 <899>      | 162 MB, 0.39 s    | 92 MB, 0.17 s

   I did a test with GCC 4.8 as well, the numbers were roughly in the same
   ballpark. Original idea coming from here (libstdc++ std::integer_sequence
   implementation, which I can't use because it's only since C++14):

    https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/libstdc++/2015-11/msg00129.html

   For a more realistic use case, compiler memory usage in
   TradeMaterialDataTest from magnum 88d2acc66e0a33113e06478859bef01d20d1e677
   (before the 5000-line monster got split into smaller pieces) went down from
   318 to 309 MB. MaterialData uses up to GenerateSequence<63> so that's the
   heaviest usage of this helper in the whole codebase.

   Further optimization could be done by using Clang's __make_integer_seq from
   https://reviews.llvm.org/D14814, however I think this is good enough now. */
