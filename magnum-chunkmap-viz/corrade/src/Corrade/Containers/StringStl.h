/** @file
@brief STL @ref std::string compatibility for @ref Corrade::Containers::String and @ref Corrade::Containers::StringView
@m_since_latest

Including this header allows you to convert a
@ref Corrade::Containers::String / @ref Corrade::Containers::StringView from
and to @ref std::string. A separate
@ref Corrade/Containers/StringStlView.h header provides compatibility with
@ref std::string_view from C++17. See
@ref Containers-String-stl "String STL compatibility" and
@ref Containers-BasicStringView-stl "StringView STL compatibility" for more
information.
