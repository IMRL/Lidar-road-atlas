namespace Corrade { namespace Containers { namespace Implementation {

/* Used by Array.h, GrowableArray.h, StaticArray.h and Optional.h; Pointer.h
   has a variant that isn't in-place so it's implemented directly in there. C++
   has a featurebug where a code like

    struct ExplicitDefault {
        explicit ExplicitDefault() = default;
    };

    struct Foo {
        ExplicitDefault a;
    };

    new Foo{};

   will cause a compile error, saying that "chosen constructor is explicit in
   copy-initialization". On GCC it would print a different warning, saying that
   "converting to ‘Foo’ from initializer list would use explicit constructor
   ‘ExplicitDefault::ExplicitDefault()’", however in some variants of the above
   GCC will be happy and Clang not.

   Doesn't happen when doing `new Foo` or `new Foo()`, but because the
   containers *deliberately* prefer {} over () in order to catch implicit
   conversion issues *and* Corrade and Magnum APIs use explicit parameter-less
   constructors very often, this is very likely to be hit by unsuspecting
   users. One workaround is to add a `Foo() {}` constructor to the struct, but
   that might have unwanted consequences, so instead it's getting worked around
   on library side by using a () when the argument list is empty. Further
   details (Clang-specific): https://stackoverflow.com/q/17264067

   This might be fixed in more recent versions of the C++ standard. */
