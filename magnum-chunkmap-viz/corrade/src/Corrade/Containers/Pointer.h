@brief Lightweight unique pointer

An alternative to @ref std::unique_ptr from C++11, provides an owning move-only
wrapper over a pointer of type @p T, calling @cpp delete @ce on it on
destruction. The @ref pointer() convenience function also provides an
equivalent for C++14 @ref std::make_unique(), but on C++11 as well. Can be also
thought of as a heap-allocated counterpart to @ref Optional.

Compared to @ref std::unique_ptr, this class does proper @cpp const @ce
propagation as would be expected from any other owning container like
@ref Array or @ref String --- i.e., it's only possible to mutate the owned data
if the instance is not @cpp const @ce. There's no STL functionality with such
behavior except for the proposed @m_class{m-doc-external} [std::indirect_value](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p1950r1.html).

Unlike @ref std::unique_ptr, this class does not provide custom deleters,
doesn't work with arrays and doesn't have a @cpp constexpr @ce API. On the
other hand that makes it fairly simple and lightweight. If you need a custom
deleter, use either @ref ScopeGuard or the standard @ref std::unique_ptr. For
owning array wrappers use @ref Array, which maintains a size information and
also supports custom deleters.

@section Containers-Pointer-stl STL compatibility

Instances of @ref Pointer are implicitly move-convertible to and from
@ref std::unique_ptr if you include @ref Corrade/Containers/PointerStl.h. The
conversion is provided in a separate header to avoid unconditional
@cpp #include <memory> @ce, which significantly affects compile times.
Additionally, the @ref pointer(T&&) overload also allows for such a conversion.
Example:

@snippet Containers-stl.cpp Pointer

<b></b>

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@par Single-header version
    This class is also available as a single-header, dependency-less
    [CorradePointer.h](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-singles/tree/master/CorradePointer.h)
    library in the Magnum Singles repository for easier integration into your
    projects. See @ref corrade-singles for more information. The above
    mentioned STL compatibility is included as well, but disabled by default.
    Enable it by specifying @cpp #define CORRADE_POINTER_STL_COMPATIBILITY @ce
    before including the file. Including it multiple times with different
    macros defined works as well.
