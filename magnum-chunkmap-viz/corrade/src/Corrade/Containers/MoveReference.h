/**
@brief Lightweight non-owning r-value reference wrapper
@m_since_latest

Counterpart to a @ref Reference that accepts r-value references. The main use
case is to store r-value references in a container --- for example when an API
needs to take a list of instances to take over ownership of. Use in a
@cpp constexpr @ce context is not envisioned for this class and so compared to
a @ref Reference the class is not @cpp constexpr @ce.

This class is exclusively for r-value references. If you want to accept only
l-value references, use a @ref Reference; if you want to accept both, use an
@ref AnyReference.

Unlike a @ref Reference, which corresponds to a @ref std::reference_wrapper,
this class doesn't have a STL equivalent. For that reason there's also no
interface to do a conversion from/to an external representation.
