@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager "PluginManager::Manager", and you need to
load them explicitly by calling @ref CORRADE_PLUGIN_IMPORT() at the beginning

automatic call:

@attention This macro should be called outside of any namespace. If you are
    running into linker errors with `pluginImporter_*`, this could be the
    reason. See @ref CORRADE_RESOURCE_INITIALIZE() documentation for more

Functions called by this macro don't do any dynamic allocation or other

/** @hideinitializer
@brief Register a static or dynamic plugin
@param name          Name of the static plugin (equivalent of dynamic plugin
     filename)
@param className     Plugin class name
@param interface     Interface name (the same as is defined by the
    @ref Corrade::PluginManager::AbstractPlugin::pluginInterface() "pluginInterface()"
    member of given plugin class)

If the plugin is built as **static** (using the CMake
@ref corrade-cmake-add-static-plugin "corrade_add_static_plugin()" command),
registers it, so it will be loaded automatically when PluginManager instance
with corresponding interface is created. When building as static plugin,
`CORRADE_STATIC_PLUGIN` preprocessor directive is defined.

If the plugin is built as **dynamic** (using the CMake
@ref corrade-cmake-add-plugin "corrade_add_plugin()" command), registers it, so
it can be dynamically loaded via @ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager by
supplying a name of the plugin. When building as dynamic plugin,
`CORRADE_DYNAMIC_PLUGIN` preprocessor directive is defined.

If the plugin is built as dynamic or static **library or executable** (not as
a plugin, using e.g. CMake command @cmake add_library() @ce /
@cmake add_executable() @ce), this macro won't do anything to prevent linker
issues when linking more plugins together. No plugin-related preprocessor
directive is defined.

See @ref plugin-management for more information about plugin compilation.

@attention This macro should be called outside of any namespace. If you are
    running into linker errors with `pluginImporter_`, this could be the
    reason.

/* In the following macros, Containers::StringView is used instead of const
   char* to have the possibility of propagating the global annotation of a
   string literal passed to instantiate() all the way to AbstractPlugin
   internals. It's however passed as const& to make it possible for people to
   implement plugins without even having to include the StringView header. */
