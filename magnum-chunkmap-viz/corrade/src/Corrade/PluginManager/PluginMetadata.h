/**
@brief Plugin metadata

This class stores metadata about a particular plugin. The plugin metadata are
stored in a plugin metadata file, which resides either besides the dynamic
plugin binary in a filesystem or is compiled directly into executable with a
static plugin. See @ref plugin-management for a tutorial and brief introduction
to how plugins work.

The plugin metadata file has a simple INI-like syntax (see
@ref Utility::Configuration class documentation for full specification). The
file stores list of dependencies (if the plugin depends on another), list of
aliases and optionally plugin-specific data and configuration. Example
`Matrix.conf` file for a `Matrix` plugin:

@code{.ini}
# Dependencies
depends=SomeRandomJohnDoesPlugin
depends=BaseMatrixPlugin
depends=SkyNetPlugin

# Aliases
provides=RealWorld
provides=RealButSlightlyTwistedWorld

# Optional plugin-specific data
[data]
description=My first matrix without bugs

# Optional plugin-specific configuration
[configuration]
redPillOrBluePill=red
@endcode

According to the configuration file, the `Matrix` plugin can be loaded only if
`SomeRandomJohnDoesPlugin`, `BaseMatrixPlugin` and `SkyNetPlugin` are found can
be loaded. It will be also loaded when requesting `RealWorld` plugin, but only
if this is the first plugin providing it.

The @cb{.ini} [data] @ce section can contain read-only data that can be used
for example to provide additional info about the plugin in a user interface and
is accessible through @ref data().

The @cb{.ini} [configuration] @ce section contains initial configuration data
that can be modified by the user to setup a particular plugin instance beyond
what's possible via the plugin interface. The initial configuration is
accessible through @ref configuration(), while a modifiable copy is stored
in each plugin instance, accessible through @ref AbstractPlugin::configuration().
