Defined if the library is built in a way that makes it possible to safely use

    to have thread-local scoped output redirection and coloring
-   @ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager "PluginManager::Manager" uses it for
    thread-local plugin loading, unloading and management

Apart from these, @ref Corrade::Utility::Resource "Utility::Resource" uses
global data but isn't affected by this option, as majority of its operation is
only reading from the global storage. All other functionality is free of any
read/write access to global data.

@brief C++ standard version

Expands to `__cplusplus` macro on all sane compilers; on MSVC uses `_MSVC_LANG`

-   @cpp 201103 @ce when C++11 is used

-   @cpp 201703 @ce when C++17 is used

-   greater than @cpp 202002 @ce when C++2b is used

Note that compilers that don't have full support for given standard may not
return the exact value, in which case it's recommended to check that the
reported value is *greater* than the previous standard, for example
@cpp #if CORRADE_CXX_STANDARD > 201703 @ce to test whether compiling as C++20.

Unlike most other `CORRADE_*` variables, this macro is not exposed to CMake as
because the meaning is unclear in projects that combine more different C++
standards in a single project.

[FMA3 instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMA_instruction_set) is enabled at compile time (`-mfma` on GCC/Clang, MSVC doesn't have a direct
option and it's only implied by `/arch:AVX2`). Superset of
@ref CORRADE_TARGET_AVX_F16C, implied by @ref CORRADE_TARGET_AVX2.

The FMA4 instruction set, which used to be supported only in certain range of
AMD processors and isn't anymore, is not detected, and AMD switched to FMA3
since. Although there's no documented relation between AVX, F16C, FMA and AVX2,
looking the history of released Intel and AMD CPUs it can be seen that all CPUs
having FMA support F16C as well, and all CPUs supporting AVX2 have FMA.

-   SVE, which is a HPC-focused alternative to NEON, in 2021 found mostly just
    on [AWS Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/)
-   SVE2, which is a next-generation vector instruction set designed to be a
    successor to both NEON and SVE, scheduled to appear in production in around
    2022
