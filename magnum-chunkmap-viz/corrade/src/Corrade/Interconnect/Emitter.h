@brief Emitter object

Contains signals and manages connections between signals and slots. See
@ref interconnect for introduction.

@section Interconnect-Emitter-signals Implementing signals

Signals are implemented as member functions with @ref Signal as return type,
argument count and types are not limited. Their body consists of a single
@ref emit() call, to which you pass pointer to the function and forward all
arguments. Example signal implementations:

@snippet Interconnect.cpp Emitter-signals

The implemented signal can be emitted simply by calling the function:

@snippet Interconnect.cpp Emitter-emit

If the signal is not declared as public function, it cannot be connected or
called from outside the class.

@m_class{m-block m-warning}

@par Connecting slots across shared objects
    If you're planning to use signal/slot connections across shared objects, be
    aware that in combination with GCC/Clang `-fvisibility-inlines-hidden`
    option (enabled by default when you use the `CORRADE_USE_PEDANTIC_FLAGS`
    @ref corrade-cmake "CMake property"), address of given signal inside a
    shared library will differ from its address outside of it. Copied from GCC
    documentation:
@par
    <blockquote>
    This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare pointers
    to inline methods where the addresses of the two functions were taken in
    different shared objects.
    </blockquote>
@par
    There are three possible solutions:
@par
    1.  Compile without `-fvisibility-inlines-hidden`. Not recommended, as you
        usually have no control over externally specified flags. This flag is
        not available on MSVC or MinGW and while MSVC "just works", MinGW
        doesn't.
    2.  Make the signal definition non-inline by moving its definition to a
        `*.cpp` file. Potentially very verbose, but works everywhere including
        MinGW.
    3.  Annotating the function with an export macro such as
        @ref CORRADE_VISIBILITY_INLINE_MEMBER_EXPORT from
        @ref Corrade/Utility/VisibilityMacros.h that puts its visibility back
        to default. Doesn't work on MinGW either.
@par
    Similar issue happens with the `-Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions` option passed to
    the linker. This flag is unfortunately present by default when building
    Ubuntu packages and has to be explicitly removed in order to make the
    signal connections work correctly. See the `package/debian/rules` file for
    an example how to do it.

<b></b>

@m_class{m-block m-danger}

@par MSVC and identical function merging
    MSVC linker has an optimization called "identical COMDAT folding"
    (`/OPT:ICF`) that looks for functions with identical generated machine code
    and merges them together to reduce binary size. This is unfortunately done
    also for functions which have their pointer taken and compared, making it a
    [non-conformant behavior](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/3brezz/do_you_know_that_different_functions_may_have_the/)
    --- the C++ standard says that different functions should have different
    pointers.
@par
    Since the core functionality of @ref Emitter is based around taking
    pointers to signals and comparing them, this optimization breaks it. The
    only reliable solution is disabling the optimization altogether using
    `/OPT:NOICF,REF` (the `REF` part means that you don't want the functions
    merged but you still want to include only functions that are referenced ---
    a valid optimization). If you're using CMake and linking to
    `Corrade::Interconnect` (even transitively), this flag is added implicitly.
    If you're using a custom buildsystem, you have to add this flag yourself to
    prevent erratic behavior.

@section Interconnect-Emitter-connections Connecting signals to slots

Signals implemented on @ref Emitter subclasses can be connected to slots using
various @ref connect() functions. The argument count and types of slot function
must be exactly the same as of the signal function. When a connection is
established, returned @ref Connection object can be used together with
@ref disconnect() to remove given connection:

@snippet Interconnect.cpp Emitter-connect

Note that the @ref Connection object is just a handle --- its destruction
* *doesn't* lead to the connection being removed. You can also call
@ref disconnectSignal() or @ref disconnectAllSignals() on the emitter to remove
the connections. All emitter connections are automatically removed when emitter
object is destroyed.

@note It is possible to connect given signal to given slot more than
    once, because there is no way to check whether the connection already
    exists. As a result, after signal is emitted, the slot function will be
    then called more than once.
@note In the slot you can add or remove connections, however you can't
    @cpp delete @ce the emitter object, as it would lead to undefined behavior.

You can connect any signal, as long as the emitter object is of proper type ---
in particular, referring a signal from a derived type while passing an emitter
of base type is not allowed:

@snippet Interconnect.cpp Emitter-connect-emitter-type

@section Interconnect-Emitter-free-slots Free function, lambda and function object slots

Slots can be simply free functions. Non-capturing lambdas, shown above, are
converted to function pointers and treated the same. These have the least call
overhead.

Capturing lambdas and function objects, as long as they are trivially copyable
and destructible and small enough (not more than three pointers) are stored
by-value similarly to free functions, but the call overhead is slightly larger.

Lambdas and function objects larger than three pointers or having non-trivial
copy / destruction are allocated on heap. This is the case of @ref std::function,
for example, and the overhead is offset by another indirection.

@attention
    Note that when using capturing lambdas or stateful function objects you
    have to ensure that all referenced data are kept in scope for as long as
    the connection is alive, which might be tricky. A better recommendation is
    to use member function slots on a @ref Receiver object as shown below ---
    there the connection gets automatically removed once the receiver goes out
    of scope.

<b></b>

@m_class{m-block m-danger}

@par MSVC and non-trivially-copyable lambdas
    For some reason, @ref std::is_trivially_copyable returns @cpp false @ce for
    any lambda type on MSVC and thus all lambdas that are not convertible to
    plain function pointers are allocated on heap on this compiler. If this
    proves to be a performance bottleneck, you can work around this limitation
    by creating a function object capturing the needed state manually.

@section Interconnect-Emitter-member-slots Member function slots

Finally, it's possible to connect signals to member functions. The receiving
object must be a subclass of @ref Receiver and @p slot must be a non-constant
member function with @cpp void @ce as a return type. In addition to the cases
mentioned above, the connection is automatically removed also when receiver
object is destroyed. You can also use @ref Receiver::disconnectAllSlots() to
disconnect the receiver from everything.

@note Unlike with emitters, it's perfectly fine to destroy the *receiver*
    object in its own slot.

@snippet Interconnect.cpp Emitter-connect-member-slot

You can connect to any member function, as long as @ref Receiver exists
somewhere in given object type hierarchy:

@snippet Interconnect.cpp Emitter-connect-receiver-type

It is also possible to connect to member function of class which itself isn't
subclass of @ref Receiver, just add @ref Receiver using multiple inheritance.
Convoluted example:

@snippet Interconnect.cpp Emitter-connect-receiver-multiple-inheritance

@see @ref Receiver, @ref Connection
@todo Allow move

@brief Connect signal to function slot

Connects given signal to compatible slot. @p emitter must be subclass of
@ref Emitter, @p signal must be implemented signal and @p slot can be either
a non-member function, a lambda or any other function object. The argument
count and types must be exactly the same.

@attention Note that in case the lambda or function object references external
    data, you need to ensure the data are in scope for the whole lifetime of
    the connection. A much safer alternative is to make use of the
    @ref Receiver object --- in that case the connection is automatically
    removed when it goes out of scope.

Connects given signal to compatible slot in receiver object. @p emitter must be
subclass of @ref Emitter, @p signal must be implemented signal, @p receiver
must be subclass of @ref Receiver and @p slot must be non-constant member
function with `void` as return type. The argument count and types must be
exactly the same.
