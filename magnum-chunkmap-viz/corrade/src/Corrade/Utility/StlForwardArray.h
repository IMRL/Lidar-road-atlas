@brief Forward declaration for @ref std::array
@m_since{2019,10}

On @ref CORRADE_TARGET_LIBCXX "libc++" and
@ref CORRADE_TARGET_DINKUMWARE "MSVC STL" includes a lightweight
implementation-specific STL header containing just the forward declaration of
@ref std::array. On other implementations where forward declaration is not
possible or is unknown is equivalent to @cpp #include <array> @ce.

<b></b>

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@par Single-header version
    This header is also available as a single-header, dependency-less
    [CorradeStlForwardArray.h](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-singles/tree/master/CorradeStlForwardArray.h)
    library in the Magnum Singles repository for easier integration into your
    projects. See @ref corrade-singles for more information.

@see @ref Corrade/Utility/StlForwardString.h,
    @ref Corrade/Utility/StlForwardTuple.h,
    @ref Corrade/Utility/StlForwardVector.h,
    @ref Corrade/Utility/StlMath.h
