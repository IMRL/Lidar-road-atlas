@brief Parser for @ref Tweakable types

Support for basic types that are expressible with plain literals is implemented
in @ref TweakableParser<int>, @ref TweakableParser<unsigned int>,
@ref TweakableParser<long>, @ref TweakableParser<unsigned long>,
@ref TweakableParser<long long>, @ref TweakableParser<unsigned long long>,
@ref TweakableParser<float>, @ref TweakableParser<double>,
@ref TweakableParser<long double> and @ref TweakableParser<char>.

@section TweakableParser-subclassing Implementing support for custom literals

The parser support is limited to what's expressible with C++11 user-defined
literals, together with an optional unary @cpp + @ce or @cpp - @ce in front.
Current implementation supports only trivially copyable and trivially
destructible types of a limited size --- in particular, saving strings is not
possible.

In order to implement support for a custom type, create a (partial) template
specialization with a @cpp parse() @ce function with the following sigature
for given type `T` --- assuming there's a user-defined C++11 literal that
returns `T` as well:

@snippet Utility.cpp TweakableParser

The function gets a view onto the contents of the annotation, with outer
whitespace stripped (so e.g. for string literals you get also the quotes
around). It returns the parsed value and a parser state. The state should be
one of the following:

-   @ref TweakableState::Success if parsing consumed the whole input and there
    was no error
-   @ref TweakableState::Error if parsing failed and the parser is *sure* that
    this is a compile error (and not suddenly a different type, for example
    --- @cpp 0xa901g0f @ce might look like an error, but it could be also a
    user-defined literal `g0f`). Examples of such errors can be unterminated
    string/char literals or unknown escape characters in them.
-   @ref TweakableState::Recompile if parsing failed and the parser is *not*
    sure that this is a compile error

Returning @ref TweakableState::NoChange is not allowed.

Note that the user-defined literal has to return a custom type that's not
already handled by the implementation. So for example a custom C++11 binary
literal @cpp 110110110_b @ce, returning @cpp int @ce and supplementing the
builtin C++14 literal @cpp 0b110110110 @ce, wouldn't be possible to implement,
since @ref TweakableParser<int> is already defined.
