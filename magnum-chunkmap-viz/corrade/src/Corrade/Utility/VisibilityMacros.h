/** @hideinitializer
@brief Export a symbol into a shared library

On non-DLL platforms, if the GCC/Clang `-fvisibility=hidden` flag is used
(recommended, enabled by default when you use the `CORRADE_USE_PEDANTIC_FLAGS`
@ref corrade-cmake "CMake property"), symbols are not exported from shared
libraries by default and you need to mark them as such in order to make them
usable from outside code. For example:

@snippet Utility.cpp CORRADE_VISIBILITY_EXPORT

On Windows when building DLLs, this gets complicated further --- everything is
implicitly hidden and you need to `dllexport` the symbols when building the
library (using the @ref CORRADE_VISIBILITY_EXPORT) but `dllimport` them when
using the library (with the @ref CORRADE_VISIBILITY_IMPORT). In practice that
means you need to define some additional macro when compiling the library and
then @cpp #define @ce an alias to one of these based on presence of that macro.
If you use CMake, such macro is implicitly provided in a form of
`<target>_EXPORTS` when compiling any file that's a part of a shared library,
so then the full setup might look like this:

@code{.cmake}
add_library(MyLibrary SHARED MyLibrary.cpp) # MyLibrary_EXPORTS defined

add_executable(my-application main.cpp) # MyLibrary_EXPORTS not defined
target_link_librariees(my-application PRIVATE MyLibrary)
@endcode

@snippet Utility.cpp CORRADE_VISIBILITY_EXPORT-dllexport

On non-DLL platforms both @ref CORRADE_VISIBILITY_EXPORT and
@ref CORRADE_VISIBILITY_IMPORT macros are defined to the same thing, so the
above code works correctly everywhere. If your library can be built as static
as well, have a look at @ref CORRADE_VISIBILITY_STATIC.

@see @ref CORRADE_VISIBILITY_LOCAL, @ref CORRADE_VISIBILITY_INLINE_MEMBER_EXPORT

/** @hideinitializer
@brief Export inline class member into a shared library
@m_since{2019,10}

If the GCC/Clang `-fvisibility-inlines-hidden` flag is used (enabled by default
when you use the `CORRADE_USE_PEDANTIC_FLAGS` @ref corrade-cmake "CMake property"),
@cpp inline @ce functions and class methods are not exported. This is generally
a good thing but may cause issues when you need to compare pointers to such
inline functions (for example signals defined in
@ref Corrade::Interconnect::Emitter "Interconnect::Emitter" subclasses) --- an
inline function defined in a shared library may have a different address inside
and outside of that library.

For free functions (and on Windows for member functions in a non-DLL-exported
class) @ref CORRADE_VISIBILITY_EXPORT / @ref CORRADE_VISIBILITY_IMPORT can be
used without issues, this macro is meant to be used on inline members of an
already DLL-exported class, since `dllexport`ing members of already
`dllexport`ed type is not allowed:

@snippet Utility.cpp CORRADE_VISIBILITY_INLINE_MEMBER_EXPORT

This macro is empty on Windows, which means there's no need for a corresponding
`*_IMPORT` variant of it. Note that this macro exports the symbol even on
static libraries, in that case you might want to use
@ref CORRADE_VISIBILITY_STATIC instead.
