/**
@brief Parser and writer for configuration files

@m_keywords{Serialization Parsers}

Provides hierarchical configuration storage for key/value pairs with support
for parsing and loading into an textual INI-style file format. Basic API usage
example:

@snippet Utility.cpp Configuration-usage

@section Utility-Configuration-usage File syntax and usage

File syntax is based on the well-known INI format, consisting of three basic
elements:

- group header
- key/value pair
- comment / empty line

@subsection Utility-Configuration-usage-whitespace Whitespace and comments

Lines can have leading/trailing whitespace, which will be stripped on parsing
and saving. Whitespace is preserved in values enclosed in `"` and in multi-line
values. Comments and empty lines are preserved unless @ref Flag::SkipComments
is set in constructor or a group containing the comment gets deleted. It's not
possible to add comments or empty lines programatically.

Comments begin with @cb{.ini} # @ce or @cb{.ini} ; @ce character and continue
to the end of line. Each line of a multiline comment must begin with one of
these characters.

@code{.ini}
# A comment
  # on
  # multiple
# lines

; Another type of comment
@endcode

@subsection Utility-Configuration-usage-values Key/value pairs

Key/value pair consist of key name string, zero or more whitespace characters,
the `=` character, zero or more whitespace characters and the value. Whitespace
around the key is always stripped. Whitespace around the value is stripped on
parsing, if you want to preserve it, enclose the value in @cb{.py} " @ce
characters. Calling @ref setValue() with a string that contains
leading/trailing whitespace will cause it to be automatically wrapped in quotes
on save.

@code{.ini}
a=    a string with leading whitespace trimmed
b="    a string with leading whitespace preserved"
@endcode

All values are internally stored as strings, parsing to and saving from custom
types is done by calling an appropriate @ref ConfigurationValue. See its
documentation for a guide to integrating your own type, see
@ref corrade-configurationvalues for a list of additional parsers implemented
in Corrade itself.

Multi-line values are enclosed in @cb{.py} """ @ce alone on the line, first and
last line break is ignored. Calling @ref setValue() with a string that contains
newline characters will cause it to be automatically enclosed in
@cb{.py} """ @ce on save. The following value is parsed as two lines:

@code{.py}
value="""
Here is the value.
Spanning multiple lines.
"""
@endcode

It's allowed to have more than one value with the same key. You can access all
values for given key name using @ref values().

@code{.ini}
buy=bread
buy=milk
buy=apples
buy=onions
@endcode

@subsection Utility-Configuration-usage-groups Value groups

Value group header is enclosed in `[` and `]`. Group name is a non-empty
sequence of characters. As with values, it's allowed to have more than one
group with the same name.

@code{.ini}
[customer]
name=John
buys=bread

[customer]
name=Jacqueline
buys=cookies
@endcode

Hierarchic group names are separated with the `/` character. A group first
contains all values and then optional subgroups. A group is a subgroup of the
previous group if it has the previous group header as a prefix. In the
following snippet, *Jake* has *Mary* and *Max* as parents, while *Joanna*
and *Ferdinand* are his grandparents, Mary's parents.

@code{.ini}
name=Jake
likes=cycling

[parent]
name=Mary
likes=nature

[parent/parent]
name=Joanna
likes=cooking

[parent/parent]
name=Ferdinand
likes=smoking pipe

[parent]
name=Max
likes=books
@endcode

For a shorter syntax, it's possible to omit names of parent groups if they
contain only subgroups and given group is the first in the list. The following
two snippets are equivalent:

@code{.ini}
[org]
[org/java]
[org/java/lang]
class=AbstractBeanFactoryListener
class=AbstractFactoryListenerProviderDelegate

[org/java/system]
[org/java/system/services]
class=BeanFactoryListenerProviderDelegateGarbageAllocator
@endcode

@code{.ini}
[org/java/lang]
class=AbstractBeanFactoryListener
class=AbstractFactoryListenerProviderDelegate

[org/java/system/services]
class=BeanFactoryListenerProviderDelegateGarbageAllocator
@endcode

@section Utility-Configuration-iteration Iteration through groups and values

Apart from accessing groups and values of known names using @ref group(),
@ref value() and friends, it's also possible to groups through all groups and
values in the configuration using @ref groups() and @ref values(). These
functions return an iterable class that then returns key/value pairs (or, in
case of groups, name/group). One possible use is to enumerate all group and
value names in the file:

@snippet Utility.cpp Configuration-iteration

When iterating through values, comments and empty lines are skipped --- while
those are preserved in the file, there's no possibility to access them in any
way.

@todo Renaming, copying groups
@todo EOL autodetection according to system on unsure/new files (default is
    preserve)
@todo Test that the configurationValueToString() isn't called with string type
    (e.g. value with spaces)
