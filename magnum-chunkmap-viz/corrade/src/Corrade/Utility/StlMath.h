@brief Include &lt;cmath&gt;, but without the heavy C++17 additions
@m_since{2019,10}

With @ref CORRADE_TARGET_LIBSTDCXX "libstdc++" from GCC 6 and newer,
@cpp #include <cmath> @ce is above 10k lines when building with `-std=c++17`.
This is due to C++17 additions to the math library, such as
@ref std::riemann_zeta(). Because these APIs are seldom used in
graphics-related tasks, it doesn't make sense to have compile times inflated by
them. If you include @ref Corrade/Utility/StlMath.h instead, it will ensure the
new functions are not present by undefining the internal
`_GLIBCXX_USE_STD_SPEC_FUNCS` macro, making @ref cmath "&lt;cmath&gt;" roughly
the same size as on C++11. If you *need* the additions, @cpp #include <cmath> @ce
before this header.

The C++17 additions are also present on @ref CORRADE_TARGET_DINKUMWARE "MSVC STL"
since version 2017 15.7, however there the additions are very lightweight, so
no workaround is needed. For Clang, at the time of writing,
@ref CORRADE_TARGET_LIBCXX "libc++" 10 doesn't have these additions yet. On
these two this header effectively does just a simple @cpp #include <cmath> @ce.

@par Single-header version
    This header is also available as a single-header, dependency-less
    [CorradeStlMath.h](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-singles/tree/master/CorradeStlMath.h)
    library in the Magnum Singles repository for easier integration into your
    projects. See @ref corrade-singles for more information.
