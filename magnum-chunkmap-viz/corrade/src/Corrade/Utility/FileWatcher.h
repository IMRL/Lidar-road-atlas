/**
@brief File watcher

Provides a non-blocking interface to watch a single file for changes. Example
usage:

@snippet Utility.cpp FileWatcher

@section Utility-FileWatcher-behavior Behavior

The generic implementation (currently used on all supported systems) checks for
file modification time and reports a change if the modification time changes.
Deleting a file and immediately recreating it with the same name will behave
the same as simply updating that file, unless the file status is checked during
the short time when it was deleted --- in that case @ref isValid() will return
@cpp false @ce and monitoring is stopped. Pass @ref Flag::IgnoreErrors to
the constructor to disable this behavior. Similarly, in some cases a file
update might first empty the contents, update modification timestamp and only
then populate it with updated data but without a second timestamp update.
Reacting to the update when the file is still empty might be counterproductive
as well, enable @ref Flag::IgnoreChangeIfEmpty to detect and ignore this case
as well.

Different OSes and filesystems have different granularity of filesystem
modification time:

-   Most native Linux filesystems (such as ext4) will report file modification
    time in millisecond precision (usually tens of milliseconds)
-   Windows, macOS and Emscripten file modification time APIs return the value
    in seconds, FAT filesystems have two-second precision

@partialsupport Available only on @ref CORRADE_TARGET_UNIX "Unix" and non-RT
    @ref CORRADE_TARGET_WINDOWS "Windows" platforms and on
    @ref CORRADE_TARGET_EMSCRIPTEN "Emscripten". On Emscripten it works on the
    virtual filesystem.

               It went through on GCC 4.7, but apparently only because it
               doesn't care; it causes build failure on Clang in case it's
               using libstdc++ < 5.5. Since it's impossible to check for a
               libstdc++ version when using Clang (the version number is A
