@brief Tweakable constants

Provides a mechanism to immediately reflect changes to literals in source code
to a running application. Useful when tweaking positions, colors, physics
factors and other constants as it reduces the usual

1.  make a change to a literal,
2.  save,
3.  compile & link,
4.  restart the application,
5.  observe the difference

@m_class{m-noindent}

workflow to just

1.  make a change to a (marked) literal,
2.  save,
3.  observe the difference.

Works best combined with a traditional hot-reload approach (such as loading a
dynamic module via @ref PluginManager), which can take care of source code
changes that tweakable constants alone can't.

@section Utility-Tweakable-usage Basic usage

Common usage is to first define a shorter alias to the @ref CORRADE_TWEAKABLE()
macro in the source file where you want to use tweakable values. It's possible
to define any alias and you can also use the `CORRADE_TWEAKABLE` name directly.
Here we'll use a single underscore:

@snippet Utility.cpp Tweakable-define

After that, enable it using @ref enable() (it's disabled by default). In all
code that gets executed from that point onwards, all literals wrapped with the
macro invocation --- in this case @cpp _() @ce --- will get recognized by it.
To reflect source changes in the app, periodically call @ref update(), for best
responsiveness ideally in each event loop iteration. The following example
implements a 2D movement, with the gravity and linear speed being tweakable:

@snippet Utility.cpp Tweakable-wrap-update

Then, if you build & run the code, the @ref update() function will reparse the
input source file each time it's saved, providing updated values for literals
marked with @cpp _() @ce in the running application. All operation is logged
into the console, with the above example you'd see something like the following
if the source gets modified while the app is running:

@code{.shell-session}
Utility::Tweakable::update(): looking for updated _() macros in main.cpp
Utility::Tweakable::update(): updating _(-9.81f) in main.cpp:14
Utility::Tweakable::update(): updating _(2.3f) in main.cpp:15
@endcode

The implementation ensures the runtime-modified values are interpreted exactly
the same way as if the code would be compiled directly from the modified source
file. If that's not possible for whatever reason, @ref update() will emit an
error and won't update anything --- at which point you can fall back to a
traditional hot reload approach, for example.

@subsection Utility-Tweakable-usage-scope Using scopes

Not all code is running in every iteration of an event loop --- and it's not
desirable to put it there just to be able to use tweakable constants. To fix
that, there's the @ref scope() function. It takes a single-parameter function
(or a lambda) and runs the contents as if the code was placed directly in the
containing block. But for every tweakable constant inside, it remembers its
surrounding scope lambda. Then, during @ref update(), whenever one of these
constants is changed, the corresponding scope lambda gets called again (with
the same parameter). So for example this way you can execute a part of a
constructor again in a response to a change of one of its init parameters:

@snippet Utility.cpp Tweakable-scope

Note that lambdas passed to @ref scope() may be called from @ref update() in a
random order and multiple times, so make sure to keep all referenced data in
scope and handle the reentrancy properly.

@subsection Utility-Tweakable-usage-disabling Disabling tweakable values

Even though the implementation is designed for @f$ \mathcal{O}(1) @f$ lookup
of tweakable values (a hashmap lookup for the file and direct indexing for
given value), you may still want to disable it entirely. There are two possibilities:

<ul><li>
    You can remove all overhead *at compile time* by defining your alias to an
    empty value, thus all tweakable literals become just surrounded by
    parentheses:

    @snippet Utility.cpp Tweakable-disable

    If you're using `CORRADE_TWEAKABLE` directly, define it to an empty value
    * *before* including @ref Corrade/Utility/Tweakable.h. The header will
    detect that and not redefine it.

    @snippet Utility.cpp Tweakable-disable-header
</li><li>
    Or you can disable it *at runtime* by not calling @ref enable(). That'll
    still make the values go through a function call, but they are simply
    passed through without any additional hashmap lookup.
</li></ul>

In both cases the @ref scope() function is practically just executing the
passed lambda and (in case the tweakable is enabled) also saving a pointer to
it, so its performance overhead is negligible. A non-enabled instance of
@ref Tweakable is internally just one pointer with no allocations involved.

@section Utility-Tweakable-limitations Limitations

This is not magic, so it comes with a few limitations:

-   It's only possible to affect values of literals annotated by the
    @ref CORRADE_TWEAKABLE() macro or its alias, this utility is not able to
    pick up changes to code around. Neither it's able to parse any arithmetic
    expressions done inside the tweakable macros --- but unary @cpp + @ce or
    @cpp - @ce for numeric types is supported.
-   Adding a new constant on a line already containing other constants might
    result in a false success, mixing up the constant values.
-   The @ref CORRADE_TWEAKABLE() macro depends on the @cpp __COUNTER__ @ce
    preprocessor variable in order to distinguish multiple tweakable constants
    on the same line. This implies that using tweakable constants in header
    files (or `*.cpp` files that get @cpp #include @ce d in other files) will
    break the counter and confuse the @ref update() function.
-   An alias to the @ref CORRADE_TWEAKABLE() has to be defined at most once in
    the whole file and all tweakable constants in that file have to use a
    single alias. On the other hand it's possible to have different aliases in
    different files.
-   Annotated literals are required to keep their type during edits --- so it's
    not possible to change e.g. @cpp _(42.0f) @ce to @cpp _(21.0) @ce, because
    that'll change the type from @cpp float @ce to @cpp double @ce. While it
    usually generates at most a warning from the compiler, such change may
    break source code change detection in unexpected ways.
-   Tweakable variables inside code that's compiled-out by the preprocessor
    (such as various @cpp #ifdef @ce s) will confuse the runtime parser, so
    avoid them entirely.
-   For simplicity of the implementation, comments are not allowed *inside* the
    tweakable macros, only whitespace.

At the moment, the implementation is *not* thread-safe.

@section Utility-Tweakable-how-it-works How it works

For each literal annotated with @ref CORRADE_TWEAKABLE() or its alias, the
class remembers its file, line and index (in order to correctly handle multiple
literals on a single line) when the code is first executed, together with a
@ref TweakableParser instance corresponding to type of the literal known at
compile time. Affected source files are then monitored with @ref FileWatcher
for changes

Upon calling @ref update(), modified files are parsed for occurrences of the
defined macro and arguments of each macro call are parsed at runtime. If there
is any change, @ref TweakableState::Success is returned and the next time code
with given annotated literal is executed (either by the caller or directly
through one of the scopes), the class will supply the updated value instead. If
no files are modified or if the modification didn't result in any literal
update, @ref TweakableState::NoChange is returned.

If parsing the updated literals fails (because of a syntax error or because the
mark is not just a literal), the @ref update() function returns
@ref TweakableState::Error and doesn't update anything, waiting for the user to
fix the error. If there is some mismatch detected (such as the constant having
a different type than before or appearing on a different line),
@ref TweakableState::Recompile is returned and you are encouraged to trigger
the classical hot-reload approach (or restart a recompiled version of the app).

@section Utility-Tweakable-extending Extending for custom types

It's possible to extend the builtin support for custom user-defined C++11
literals by providing a specialization of the @ref TweakableParser class. See
its documentation for more information.
