@brief Forward declaration for @ref std::string
@m_since{2019,10}

On @ref CORRADE_TARGET_LIBCXX "libc++" and
@ref CORRADE_TARGET_LIBSTDCXX "libstdc++" includes a lightweight
implementation-specific STL header containing just the forward declaration of
@ref std::string. On @ref CORRADE_TARGET_DINKUMWARE "MSVC STL" and other
implementations where forward declaration is not possible or is unknown is
equivalent to @cpp #include <string> @ce.

@attention On libc++, the forward declaration header contains just
    @ref std::string and @ref std::wstring. While that is enough for majority
    of cases, types like @ref std::u32string are not there and in that case
    you need to @cpp #include <string> @ce in its complete form. You can detect
    this case using the @ref CORRADE_TARGET_LIBCXX macro.

@par Single-header version
    This header is also available as a single-header, dependency-less
    [CorradeStlForwardString.h](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-singles/tree/master/CorradeStlForwardString.h)
    library in the Magnum Singles repository for easier integration into your
    projects. See @ref corrade-singles for more information.
