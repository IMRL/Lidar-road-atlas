@brief Third-party dependencies and their corresponding license information

This page lists libraries, data files and other components that some Corrade
libraries, plugins, executables or tests depend on. See the
@ref corrade-mainpage-license "main page" for license of Corrade itself. For
easier overview the dependencies are color-coded:

-   A @m_class{m-label m-dim} **dim** or no label marks dependencies that have
    no license requirements, such as usage of public APIs like Vulkan or OpenAL
    or usage of platform-specific interfaces.
-   A @m_class{m-label m-success} **green** label marks licenses that make the
    dependency safe to use in a commercial setting without having to release
    your source code, usually requiring you to give attribution.
-   A @m_class{m-label m-primary} **light blue** label marks public domain
    software. In some countries there's no notion of public domain, in which
    case there might be a fallback license as well.
-   A @m_class{m-label m-warning} **yellow** label marks licenses that require
    you to either dynamically link to the software to be able to use it in a
    commercial setting or release your source code as well. In some cases there
    is an alternative commercial licensing option without this requirement.
-   A @m_class{m-label m-danger} **red** label marks licenses that
    unconditionally require you to publish your software together with its
    source code. In some cases there is an alternative commercial licensing
    option without this requirement.

Documentation of each linked library / plugin / executable has more detailed
information about the dependencies used. Especially in case of plugins in most
cases there are alternative implementations with different licensing
requirements. Please note that it's not guaranteed that the licensing info
provided is in any way accurate or complete, you should always check with a
lawyer to be sure.

There's also a list of @ref corrade-credits-contributors "people and organizations that contributed to Corrade".

Listing only people with code contributions or other significant work, because
otherwise there's too many :) There's also a list of
@ref corrade-credits-third-party "third party components with their license info".
Big thanks to everyone involved!
