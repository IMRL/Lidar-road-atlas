# This thing used to use MSYS's pacman to fetch lcov. However:
#
# - the lcov 1.13 package there was empty for some reason, so we had to
#   download the source on our own (https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues/1628)
# - at some point, MSYS repos got new packagers and we had to update the
#   keyring by hand (https://www.msys2.org/news/#2020-06-29-new-packagers)
# - then, zstd-compressed packages happened, however the used version of pacman
#   didn't understand zstd yet, so for perl, which lcov depends on, we had to
#   manually download an archive that was still compressed with XZ (instead of
#   going the more complicated way of updating pacman itself first, in every CI
#   run)
# - and THEN, since 2021-11-20, the perl XZ packages were removed, causing a
#   404, but a rather weird one, since curl just downloaded the 404 page but
#   didn't treat that as an error
#
# Then I made a step back and laughed at the needless suffering, because
# AppVeyor ships Perl on its own and since we fetch our own lcov anyway, the
# MSYS insanity is not needed for ANYTHING AT ALL, in fact.
