@section changelog-integration-latest Changes since 2020.06

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-new New features

-   Conversion between dynamic Eigen types and
    @ref Corrade::Containers::StridedArrayView "Containers::StridedArrayView"
    using @ref EigenIntegration::arrayCast() (see [mosra/magnum-integration#74](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/74))

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-changes Changes and improvements

-   @ref BulletIntegration now supports Bullet compiled for double precision as
    well
-   Made it possible to override and call
    @ref BulletIntegration::MotionState::getWorldTransform() /
    @ref BulletIntegration::MotionState::setWorldTransform() from user code
-   Implemented conversion for @ref Math::Range in @ref EigenIntegration
-   It's now possible to supply additional ImGui user configuration by defining
    the `MAGNUM_IMGUIINTEGRATION_USER_CONFIG` macro. See the
    @ref ImGuiIntegration namespace documentation for an example, see also
    [mosra/magnum-integration#85](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/85).
-   Support for @ref Platform::Sdl2Application::Cursor::No "Platform::*Application::Cursor::No"
    in @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context (see [mosra/magnum-integration#92](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/92))
-   @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context now supports the `VtxOffset` introduced in
    1.71, allowing to draw complex UIs that need more than 65k vertices (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#82](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/82)
    and [mosra/magnum-integration#90](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/90))
-   @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context now supports the new ImGui IO API introduced
    in 1.87, falling back to the previous behavior for older versions (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#87](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/87),
    [mosra/magnum-integration#91](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/91)
    and [mosra/magnum-integration#93](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/93))

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-buildsystem Build system

-   Updated `FindImGui.cmake` to optionally include the new `imgui_tables.cpp`
    source present in latest versions (see [mosra/magnum-integration#78](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/78),
    [mosra/magnum-integration#81](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/81))
-   Updated `FindImGui.cmake` to link to `imm32` on MinGW, which is needed
    since ImGui 1.82.
-   Travis banned everyone from using their CI and so all Linux, macOS,
    Emscripten, Android and iOS builds were migrated from Travis to Circle CI,
    together with adding also an explicit ARM64 build and an ability to test
    GLES and Vulkan functionality on Android. See also
    [mosra/magnum#350](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/350) and
    [mosra/magnum#523](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/523).
-   `FindBullet.cmake` now attemps to discover presence of the
    `BT_USE_DOUBLE_PRECISION` preprocessor macro on both system-wide and
    subproject workflow and adds it to the imported target to prevent linker
    errors
-   The Homebrew package now uses `std_cmake_args` instead of hardcoded build
    type and install prefix, which resolves certain build issues (see
    [mosra/homebrew-magnum#6](https://github.com/mosra/homebrew-magnum/pull/6))
-   On CMake 3.16 and newer, `FindMagnumIntegration.cmake` can provide
    additional details if some component is not found
-   Updated Debian build instructions to pass `--no-sign` to
    `dpkg-buildpackage`, avoiding a confusing error message that might lead
    people to think the packaging failed (see [mosra/magnum-plugins#105](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/issues/105))

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context now properly uses the `IdxOffset` introduced
    in 1.71. As of 1.86 it no longer has an implicit value, causing visual
    glitches. See also [mosra/magnum-integration#86](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/86)
    and [mosra/magnum-integration#88](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/88).

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-compatibility Potential compatibility breakages, removed APIs

-   Removed `BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::DebugMode`, `DebugModes`, `mode()`
    and `setDebugMode()` deprecated in 2018.10, use
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Mode,
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Modes "Modes",
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::mode() "mode()" and
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::setMode() "setMode()" instead

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-documentation Documentation

-   Various improvements, fixes and clarifications (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#75](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/75),
    [mosra/magnum-integration#95](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/95))
-   Documented how to enable ImGui in Debian packages (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#73](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/73))

@section changelog-integration-2020-06 2020.06

Released 2020-06-27, tagged as
[v2020.06](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/releases/tag/v2020.06).

@subsection changelog-integration-2020-06-new New features

-   New @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context::updateApplicationCursor() allowing
    ImGui to update application cursor using the new
    @ref Platform::Sdl2Application::setCursor() "*Application::setCursor()"
    APIs (see [mosra/magnum-integration#56](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/56),
    [mosra/magnum-integration#71](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/71)
    and [mosra/magnum-integration#72](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/72))

@subsection changelog-integration-2020-06-changes Changes and improvements

-   Simplified @ref DartIntegration internals using @ref EigenIntegration,
    ignoring NaN values sometimes coming from DART (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#58](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/58))
-   @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context::drawFrame() now resets scissor rectangle
    back to the full framebuffer to avoid nasty surprises when scissor test is
    not disabled again right after (see [mosra/magnum-examples#68](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/68))
-   @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context::handleKeyPressEvent() now treats
    @ref Platform::Sdl2Application::KeyEvent::Key::NumEnter "Platform::*Application::KeyEvent::Key::NumEnter"
    the same way as @ref Platform::Sdl2Application::KeyEvent::Key::Enter "Key::Enter"
-   Exposing font atlas texture via @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context::atlasTexture()
    (see [mosra/magnum-integration#60](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/60),
    [mosra/magnum-integration#61](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/61),
    [mosra/magnum-integration#62](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/62)
    and [mosra/magnum-integration#63](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/63))
-   Avoid using obsolete ImGui APIs in tests (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#65](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/65))
-   Library version is now exposed through `MAGNUMINTEGRATION_VERSION_YEAR`,
    `MAGNUMINTEGRATION_VERSION_MONTH`, `MAGNUMINTEGRATION_VERSION_COMMIT`,
    `MAGNUMINTEGRATION_VERSION_HASH` and `MAGNUMINTEGRATION_VERSION_STRING`
    preprocessor defines in a new `Magnum/versionIntegration.h` header. This
    header is not included by any other header to avoid trigerring a full
    rebuild when Git commit changes. If Git is not found, only the first two
    defines are present.
-   @ref ImGuiIntegration now uses Magnum's own @cpp Shaders::Flat2D @ce
    instead of a custom shader, which finally makes it work on GLES2 and WebGL
    1

@subsection changelog-integration-2020-06-buildsystem Build system

-   Various minor fixes (see [mosra/magnum-integration#68](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/68))
-   The library again compiles and tests cleanly with @ref CORRADE_NO_ASSERT
    enabled, and this setup is verified on the CI to avoid further regressions
-   Updated @ref GlmIntegration tests to build against 0.9.9.8 (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#70](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/70))

@subsection changelog-integration-2020-06-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   Due to a SDL2 bug on Windows that halts all event processing when dragging
    a window across the screen, ImGui v1.68 and newer would receive zero delta
    time and assert. @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context now detects that and passes
    a non-zero delta time in that case. See also [mosra/magnum-integration#57](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/57).

@subsection changelog-integration-2020-06-documentation Documentation

-   Various fixes and clarifications (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#66](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/66))

@section changelog-integration-2019-10 2019.10

Released 2019-10-24, tagged as
[v2019.10](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/releases/tag/v2019.10).

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-10-dependencies Dependency changes

-   Minimal supported CMake version is now 3.4. Older versions are not
    supported anymore and all workarounds for them were removed. Download a
    prebuilt release of a newer version if you need to use Corrade on older
    systems (such as Ubuntu 14.04 or Debian 8). This is a conservative change
    that shouldn't affect any additional distribution compared to the CMake 3.1
    requirement in 2019.01.

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-10-new New features

-   MSVC 2019 compatibility, following other Magnum projects
-   When using Magnum as a CMake subproject, it now puts all binaries into a
    common directory to simplify `PATH` handling and dynamic plugin loading.
    For more information see @ref cmake-integration-subproject,
    [mosra/magnum#357](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/357) and
    [mosra/magnum-plugins#63](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/issues/63).
-   New @ref EigenIntegration library, providing conversion of math types from
    and to [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) APIs (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#40](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/40))
-   New @ref ImGuiIntegration::imageButton() widget for drawing an image button
    out of @ref GL::Texture2D (see [mosra/magnum-integration#38](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/38))

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-10-changes Changes and improvements

-   @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context::handleKeyPressEvent() "ImGuiIntegration::Context::handleKey*Event()"
    now handles the @m_class{m-label m-default} **Space** key as well (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#44](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/44))
-   @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context::handleMousePressEvent() and
    @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context::handleMouseReleaseEvent() are fixed to
    avoid ignoring mouse clicks if both press and release happens in the same
    frame
-   Assorted @ref DartIntegration updates (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#47](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/47)):
    -   @ref DartIntegration::convertShapeNode() can now handle cones as well
    -   Converted shapes now look less like a plastic, soft bodies having
        smooth normals and no specular highlights
    -   @ref DartIntegration::World::step() takes an optional parameter to
        reset commands
-   @ref DartIntegration::World can now work with an external plugin manager
    instance
-   @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context::relayout() now rebuilds the glyph cache
    also when fonts change, not just on pixel density change (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#51](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/51))
-   Added Super key (Windows/⌘) handling to
    @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context::handleKeyPressEvent() "ImGuiIntegration::Context::handleKey*Event()"

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-10-buildsystem Build system

-   The `package/msys` directory now contains `PKGBUILD`s for
    [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). See @ref building-integration-packages-msys
    for more information. See also [mosra/magnum-integration#39](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/39)
    and [mosra/magnum#317](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/pull/317).
-   If both a CMake-based ImGui installation is found and `IMGUI_DIR` is set
    when building, `FindImGui.cmake` prefers the location given by `IMGUI_DIR`
-   ES 2.0 and ES 3.0 subset of tests requiring GL context is now run on Travis
    CI using SwiftShader for better code coverage (see
    [mosra/magnum#207](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/207))
-   Updated Homebrew package to build also the @ref DartIntegration, since
    the `dartsim` dependency is usable now (see [mosra/magnum-integration#46](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/46))
-   Emscripten builds now have the `-fPIC` option disabled by default as it
    causes linker errors related to `__memory_base` on 1.38.36 (see also
    [emscripten-core/emscripten#8761](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/8761))
-   Explicitly mention that @ref ImGuiIntegration is not available in
    @ref building-integration-packages-brew "Homebrew packages" due to a
    missing dependency (see [mosra/magnum-integration#49](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/49))
-   Updated `FindImGui.cmake` to explicitly link to the `ApplicationServices`
    framework on macOS, since that's needed for ImGui 1.71 clipboard handling
    (see [mosra/magnum-integration#48](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/48))
-   @ref BulletIntegration can now use Bullet from Emscripten Ports instead of
    looking for a prebuilt version elsewhere when the
    `USE_EMSCRIPTEN_PORTS_BULLET` CMake option is enabled. See
    @ref building-integration-features-emscripten-ports and
    [mosra/magnum-integration#53](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/53).

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-10-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   The @ref ImGuiIntegration::image() widget was flipping the texture
    vertically (see [mosra/magnum-integration#38](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/38))
-   @ref DartIntegration::convertShapeNode() was orienting cylinders and
    capsules improperly (see [mosra/magnum-integration#47](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/47))
-   Headers in the @ref ImGuiIntegration library had messed up include guards
    (see [mosra/magnum-integration#50](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/50))

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-10-compatibility Potential compatibility breakages, removed APIs

-   Removed `BulletIntegration::convertShape()` as it was depending on the
    now-removed `Shapes` library, deprecated since 2018.10

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-10-documentation Documentation

-   @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context now mentions possible pitfalls when
    supplying in-memory fonts to ImGui (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#42](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/42))
-   Better documenting the need for extra CMake modules when using
    @ref ImGuiIntegration (see [mosra/magnum-examples#64](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/64))

@section changelog-integration-2019-01 2019.01

Released 2019-02-04, tagged as
[v2019.01](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/releases/tag/v2019.01).

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-dependencies Dependency changes

-   Minimal supported GCC version is now 4.8.1, GCC 4.7 is not supported
    anymore. Minimal Clang version is now 3.3, since that's the first version
    with a complete C++11 support. See also
    [mosra/magnum#274](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/274).
-   Minimal supported CMake version is now 3.1. Older versions are not
    supported anymore and all workarounds for them were removed. Download a
    prebuilt release of a newer version if you need to use Corrade on older
    systems (such as Ubuntu 14.04 or Debian 8). See also
    [mosra/magnum#274](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/274).

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-new New features

-   New @ref ImGuiIntegration library to render
    [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) user interfaces (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#33](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/33)
    and [mosra/magnum#36](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/36))

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   Conversion of 3x3 matrices in the @ref BulletIntegration was transposing
    them by mistake. This was only discoverable if the transformation of
    objects attached to @ref BulletIntegration::MotionState included rotation.
    See also [mosra/magnum-integration#34](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/34).

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-deprecated Deprecated APIs

-   The `Magnum/OvrIntegration/Conversion.h` header name was not consistent
    with other libraries and thus is deprecated, use
    @ref Magnum/OvrIntegration/Integration.h instead

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-compatibility Potential compatibility breakages, removed APIs

-   Removed `MAGNUM_*INTEGRATION_LIBRARIES` and `MAGNUM_*INTEGRATION_INCLUDE_DIRS`
    CMake variables, which were deprecated in favor of `MagnumIntegration::*`
    imported targets in February 2016.

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-documentation Documentation

-   The @ref BulletIntegration::MotionState docs gave a false impression that
    the transformation update is two-way, while it is only from bullet to
    @ref SceneGraph. The docs are now clarified and suggest possible solutions.
    See also [mosra/magnum-integration#35](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/35).

@section changelog-integration-2018-10 2018.10

Released 2018-10-23, tagged as
[v2018.10](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/releases/tag/v2018.10).

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-10-new New features

-   New @ref GlmIntegration library that provides conversion and debug output
    for [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/) math types.

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-10-changes Changes and improvements

-   Updated the @ref OvrIntegration library to work with OVR SDK 1.17 and newer
    and adapted it to work with latest changes in the @ref GL library
    (see [mosra/magnum-integration#26](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/26)
    and [mosra/magnum-integration#32](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/32))
-   It's now possible to construct @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw without an
    active GL context using the @ref NoCreate tag

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-10-buildsystem Build system

-   There's now a PPA for Ubuntu packages. See @ref building-integration-packages-deb
    for more information. See also
    [mosra/magnum-integration#31](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/31).

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-10-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   Sometimes Bullet reports object transformation full of NaNs. Unsure what
    the real cause is but NaNs trigger an axis normalization assert in
    @ref Math::Matrix4::rotation(), so the @ref BulletIntegration::MotionState
    class is ignoring this case with a warning.

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-10-deprecated Deprecated APIs

-   `BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::DebugMode`, `DebugModes`, `mode()` and
    `setDebugMode()` are deprecated, use @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Mode,
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Modes "Modes",
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::mode() "mode()" and
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::setMode() "setMode()" instead. The
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Mode "Mode" and
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Modes "Modes" enums were deprecated by
    mistake in 2018.02, now they are reverted back to non-deprecated state.
-   `BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Mode::FastWirefram` has a typo and is
    deprecated, use @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Mode::FastWireframe
    instead

Changelogs for previous versions are available in
@ref changelog-integration-old "Archived integration changelogs".
