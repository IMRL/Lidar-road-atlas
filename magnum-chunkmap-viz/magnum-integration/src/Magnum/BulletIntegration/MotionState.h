/**
@brief Bullet Physics motion state

Encapsulates `btMotionState` as a @ref SceneGraph feature.

@section BulletIntegration-MotionState-usage Usage

Common usage is to either create a `btRigidBody` to share transformation with
a @ref SceneGraph::Object by passing the motion state in its constructor:

@snippet BulletIntegration.cpp MotionState-usage

This way, the scene graph will be affected automatically by the Bullet
simulation. It's also possible to attach the motion state afterwards:

@snippet BulletIntegration.cpp MotionState-usage-after

Note that in the other direction, the transform is propagated from the scene
graph to the rigid body only during the initial creation of the
@cpp btRigidBody @ce or when you explicitly set the body as kinematic (which
however makes it mostly a passive collision object):

@snippet BulletIntegration.cpp MotionState-kinematic

In order to update the transformation of a non-kinematic body, set the
transform directly on the @cpp btRigidBody @ce:

@snippet BulletIntegration.cpp MotionState-update

Keep in mind that changes to a rigid body using
@cpp btRigidBody::setWorldTransform() @ce may only update the motion state of
non-static objects and while @cpp btDynamicsWorld::stepSimulation() @ce is
called.

@attention All objects with a @ref MotionState attached that are part of the
    same Bullet world need to have a single common parent object, otherwise the
    transformations will not propagate correctly.
